# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code when working in this repository.

## What this project is

pw-books is a small library-management app built **solely to be a target for
Playwright practice** — API testing, UI testing, and database-connection
testing. It is not a production app. When making decisions, optimize for
"does this give useful, varied surface to automate against" over
"is this how a real library SaaS would do it."

Full scope lives in [`docs/features.md`](docs/features.md). The build is
sequenced in [`docs/tasks/01-mvp-build-plan.md`](docs/tasks/01-mvp-build-plan.md)
— follow that phase order rather than jumping ahead, and check items off as
they're completed.

## Architecture

npm workspaces + Turborepo monorepo:

- `apps/api` — Express + TypeScript backend, SQL Server via the `mssql`
  package, JWT auth
- `apps/web` — Vite + vanilla TypeScript frontend (no UI framework —
  deliberately using raw DOM so there's real markup to write Playwright
  locators against)
- `apps/db` — no application code; just migration/seed SQL and small Node
  scripts (`migrate`, `seed`, `verify`) that run against the SQL Server
  instance already installed on the machine — **no Docker container**. See
  [`docs/database-setup.md`](docs/database-setup.md) for one-time local
  instance setup (auth mode, login, TCP/IP).

Root `npm run dev` runs `turbo run dev`, which runs `db#verify` (a quick
connect check against the local instance) before starting the API and Vite
dev server together. The API also retries its DB connection pool on
transient failures rather than crashing.

## Conventions

- TypeScript everywhere, `strict: true`. No `any` unless truly justified.
- Biome is the only linter/formatter — don't add ESLint/Prettier alongside
  it. Run `npm run lint` / `npm run format` from the root.
- Keep the frontend framework-free. Don't introduce React/Vue/etc. — the
  point is practicing selectors against plain HTML, not framework testing
  patterns.
- API error responses always use the shape `{ error: { message, code } }`.
- Prefer adding a new, clearly-named endpoint/UI element over overloading an
  existing one with flags — this app's job is to have lots of distinct,
  learnable surface, not to be DRY.
- Env vars are documented in `.env.sample`; never commit a real `.env`.

## Commands (once scaffolded)

- `npm run dev` — start DB + API + web together
- `npm run build` — build API and web via Turbo
- `npm run lint` / `npm run format` — Biome across all workspaces
- `npm run db:migrate` / `npm run db:seed` — from `apps/db`

## Working in this repo

- Check `docs/tasks/01-mvp-build-plan.md` for current phase/progress before
  starting new work; update checkboxes as tasks complete.
- If scope changes, update `docs/features.md` to match — it's the source of
  truth for what should exist, not this file.
- This repo intentionally does not include a Playwright test suite itself
  (see "Explicitly deferred" in the task plan) — don't add one unless asked.
